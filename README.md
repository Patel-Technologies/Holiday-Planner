## Introduction

- The Holiday Planner Web App is designed to facilitate the planning and organization of trips with multiple users. It includes features such as user management, group creation, trip planning, budget management, and OTP verification for user registration.
- Also App Includes SMS and Call based notification system for budget management.

## Motivation
- In today's world, everyone is busy with their lives and often doesn't have the time to plan their holidays. That's why I came up with the idea of helping people plan their holidays with friends and family.
- Additionally, when planning a trip, prices for tickets and accommodations can fluctuate. Sometimes, they may decrease in the future, making it challenging to decide when to book. To address this, I developed an idea to provide notifications when prices decrease, along with information about booking platforms and trip details.

## Features

1. **User Management:**
   - User registration with mandatory fields in profile page(Name, Age, Gender, DOB, ContactNO, EmailID).
   - User login with mobile OTP authentication.
   - User profile management.

2. **Group Management:**
   - Create groups for trip planning.
   - List user's groups.
   - Retrieve group details.

3. **Trip Planning:**
   - Plan trips within groups.
   - Specify trip details (dates, source, destination, mode of travel, budget, etc.).
   - Update and delete trips.
   - Check expenses periodically.

4. **Budget Management:**
   - Check if trip expenses are within budget.
   - Send notifications if expenses fits under the budget. (Sent to all users in the group)
   - Call when expenses fits in the budget. (Call to owner of the group)

5. **OTP Verification:**
   - Secure user registration with OTP verification via SMS (4-digit code).

## Approach

Our approach to building the Holiday Planner Web App involved several key steps and considerations:

1. **Identifying the Problem:** I recognized the common challenge that many people face todayâ€”finding the time to plan holidays and ensuring that they get the best deals on travel and accommodations.

2. **Idea Development:** I brainstormed ideas to address this problem and decided to create a web application that simplifies holiday planning, allows users to collaborate with friends and family, and provides notifications when travel prices decrease.

3. **Technology Stack Selection:** I carefully selected the technology stack for both the frontend and backend of the application. This included choosing React and Redux for the frontend, Node.js and Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB for the database.

4. **API Integration:** I integrated Plivo API to enhance the functionality of the application.

5. **Security and Data Privacy:** Ensuring the security and privacy of user data was a top priority. I implemented secure authentication with OTP verification and followed best practices for data protection.

6. **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation was created to facilitate ease of use and future development of the application. This includes this README file, which provides detailed information on setup, usage, and guidelines.
